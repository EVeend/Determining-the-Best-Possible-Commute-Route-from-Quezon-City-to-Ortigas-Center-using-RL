# Determining the Best Possible Commute Route from Quezon City to Ortigas Center
using Reinforcement Learning

ABSTRACT

This study is all about determining the best possible commute
route from Quezon City to Ortigas Center using reinforcement
learning. According to Numbeo’s Traffic Index by Country 2015
Mid-Year report, the Philippines had a traffic index score of
201.31, placing third behind Thailand and Iran. The studyalso
reported that the average one-way commuting and traveling time
or time index in thePhilippines spans 46.09 minutes before people
reach their destination. A majority (60%) of theFilipino
respondents said their commutes are getting more expensive,
mainly because of higherfares, higher fuel costs, choosing taxis
and ride-hailing services over cheaper options.

The researchers aimed to compute for the best possible
commute path using reinforcement learning, in terms of distance,
speed of transport unit, traffic level, weather, timeof the day,
transportation fare, and estimated travel time that suited a
person’s commutingroutine best while on the streets of Ortigas
Center and with Quezon City as the initial location.

The researchers had used comparative research to validate
their approach. Based from theresults, it can be concluded that
reinforcement learning can be used to solve path-finding
problems with specified constraints. The time the agent needs,
provided the factors that affect acommuter’s travel time, to
determine the possible commute route is between 5 to 10 minutes.
They were also able to provide a better route compared to the
other two systems, Google Transit and Sakay.ph, with a mean
average of 22.30 PhP in terms of transportation fare and an
average of 46.57 minutes in terms of estimated travel time in
minutes.
